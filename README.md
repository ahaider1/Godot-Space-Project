# Shape Shooter 2D
This was a personal project created alongside another programmer in an attempt to build a video game using a high-level language in GDScript. Having had experience with low-level programming in C++, we wished to use this language and the Godot Game Engine to see if we could design and create a functional video game with our knowledge of software development and design.

**Design Principles**
Spearheaded by my other collaborator, we recognise the importance of a good workflow when implementing content at the end of the project. Hence, we designed to use composition to create reusable components that allow us to create enemies and weapons simply by modifying these components and altering key values like damage. We also made use of singleton design principles by creating scripts that could manage game logic and level transitions by being omni-present throuhgout our game.

**Game Features**
The game features 10 hand-crafted levels in a 2D-shape aesthetic (hence the name) featuring 10+ enemies and upgrades, as well as 2 bosses to encounter. You progress through the levels and buy upgrades from hard-earned cashed you collected from killing enemies. These upgrades are randomized each level and you may not be able to afford every single one, so plan accordingly.

The game also features a tutorial, main menu, death screen and pause screen.
